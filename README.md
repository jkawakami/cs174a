All aspects of the assignment should be done. 

Extra credit:
1. each of the 8 cubes were implemented from the same data but were not done as a triangle strip.
2. I made it so that the cubes smoothly, continuously rotate around their initial positions, but not scale.
3. The rotate function used quaternions in navigation.
4. I submitted this assignment using the github repository.
